"""Extract import edges from a parse tree.

Two rules govern this module, and both come from ``docs/metrics.md`` section 4.1:

* **A full-tree walk, not a scan of top-level statements.** Imports hide inside
  ``if TYPE_CHECKING:`` blocks, function bodies and conditional branches. Missing them
  silently under-reports coupling, which is the failure mode that turns a layer gate into a
  false-negative machine.
* **Nothing is ever silently dropped.** An import OXN cannot resolve is recorded with
  ``resolved=False`` and its raw specifier, and surfaced in the CLI output. Dropping it
  would quietly hide a layer violation.

Every edge carries a ``kind``: a ``type_only`` import creates no runtime coupling and is
excluded from ``DEPENDS_ON`` by default, which is what Martin's metrics mean by a dependency.
